# Sentiment Analysis – Text Classifier

This project performs **sentiment analysis** on text input, classifying it as positive, negative, or neutral using a simple machine‑learning or NLP pipeline.

## Features

- Takes text input from the user (CLI or script).
- Preprocesses text (lowercasing, removing punctuation, etc.).
- Predicts sentiment using a trained model or prebuilt sentiment library.
- Prints predicted label and, optionally, a confidence score.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Typical libraries (depending on your implementation), for example:
  - `scikit-learn` and `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - or an NLP library such as `textblob` / `transformers`

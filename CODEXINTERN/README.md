# CODEXINTERN – Python Virtual Internship Tasks

This directory contains the Python projects completed as part of the **CODEXINTERN Virtual Internship** program. Each project focuses on applying Python to real-world problems using APIs, speech and text processing, and basic machine learning.

## Projects

- `Gemini_api` – Chat interface powered by the Gemini API (and optional real‑time search integration).
- `Sentiment_anly` – Sentiment analysis on text input using a machine‑learning or NLP model.
- `Speech_img` – Convert text to images (and optionally use speech input) using a generative image API.
- `Voice-assistant` – Modular voice assistant that responds to voice commands and fetches weather data.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3
- **Key libraries**: `requests`, `speechrecognition`, `pyttsx3`, `pyaudio` (or alternative), NLP / ML libraries depending on the task
- **APIs**: Gemini API, OpenWeather API, image generation API (e.g., Gemini or similar)
